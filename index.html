                    Hello! My name is Ittipat Wattanapongwanitch. People call me by my nickname Dolla. Born and raised in Thailand, I have attended Thai-Chinese International School (TCIS) since I was young. As I will be graduating from TCIS this year, I wish to attend college abroad since this would allow me to broaden out my experience and be able to absorb other cultures outside of Thailand. To know more about me, some of my personal hobbies include cooking, repairing/dissembling/building things, and strength training. My favorite food cuisines are Japanese and Korean cuisines where they highlight their ingredients through minimal seasoning. I have always been interested in creating and optimizing things people use around the world and also the fitness lifestyle. While most people would see me as a reserved person, the reason for such a personality lies in the fact that my head is constantly thinking about different things and how I fail to process it into speech. Aside from being quiet, I would also describe myself as an independent and reliable person who is committed to getting things done. My personal goals in life include opening a family run healthy restaurant, improving the accessibility to healthcare system, and travel around the world as much as possible. Countries that I have been to include Singapore, Japan, and Hongkong. At the end of the day, I am someone who holds to the notion that as a person, we shouldnâ€™t try to please everyone in the world but instead, be the best person you could possibly be.
